1 month training window

6 month training window

What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?
The 6 month training window has better actual returns over the long run than the 1 month training window.

Long window decreased to 50

Long window increased to 200

What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows? Decreasing the long window to 50 gave similar results to the base model, with slightly worse results. Increasing the logn window to 200 resulted in opposing returns compared to the base model.
